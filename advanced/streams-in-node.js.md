# Streams in Node.js

Streams are objects that enable you to read data or write data continuously.

There are four types of streams:

**Readable –** Used for reading operations

**Writable −** Used for writing operations

**Duplex −** Can be used for both reading and writing operations

**Transform −** A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on the input
