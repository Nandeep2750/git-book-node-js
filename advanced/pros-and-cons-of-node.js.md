| Pros                                                                                               | Cons                                                                              |

| **Fast processing** and an **event-based** model                                                   | **Not suitable for heavy computational tasks**                                    |
| Uses JavaScript, which is well-known among developers                                              | Using callback is complex since you end up with several **nested callbacks**      |
| Node Package Manager has over **50,000 packages** that provide the functionality to an application | Dealing with **relational databases is not a good option for Node.js**            |
| Best suited for streaming **huge amounts of data and I/O-intensive operations**                    | Since Node.js is single-threaded, **CPU-intensive tasks are not its strong suit** |
