# REPL in Node.js

REPL stands for **Read Eval Print Loop**, and it represents a computer environment. Itâ€™s similar to a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell in which a command is entered. Then, the system responds with an output.

## R - Read

reads the user's input, parses it into a JavaScript data structure, and then stores it in memory.

## E - Eval

receives and evaluates the data structure.

## P - Print

Prints the final result

## L - Loop

Loops the provided command until CTRL+C is pressed twice
