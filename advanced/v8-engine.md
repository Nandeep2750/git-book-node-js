description: Why does Google use the V8 engine for Node.js?
---

# V8 engine

* The V8 engine, developed by Google, is **open-source** and written in **C++**.
* Google makes use of the V8 engine because it can **easily convert JavaScript into a low-level language**.
* This is done to provide **high performance during the execution** of an application.
* Also provides users with real-time abilities to work with the application.
* Google Chrome makes use of this engine.&#x20;

V8, unlike the other engines, is also utilized for the popular Node.js runtime. V8 was initially intended to **improve the speed of JavaScript execution within web browsers**. Instead of employing an interpreter, V8 converts JavaScript code into more efficient machine code to increase performance. It turns JavaScript code into machine code during execution by utilizing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, as do many current JavaScript engines such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla).
