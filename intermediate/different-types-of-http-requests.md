# Different types of HTTP requests

HTTP defines a set of request methods used to perform desired actions. The request methods include:

* **GET:** Used to retrieve the data.
* **POST:** Generally used to make a change in state or reactions on the server.
* **PUT:** The PUT method updates an instance of a resource by replacing the existing resource with the resource provided in the request body.
* **HEAD:** Similar to the GET method, but asks for the response without the response body.
* **DELETE:** Used to delete the predetermined resource.
