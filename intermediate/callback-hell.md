# Callback Hell

Callback hell in Node.js is the situation in which we have **complex nested callbacks**. In this, each callback takes arguments that have been obtained as a result of previous callbacks. This kind of callback structure leads to lesser code readability and maintainability.

The shape of the resulting code structure resembles a pyramid, and hence callback hell is also called the “**Pyramid of the Doom**”.
