# Why is Node.js single-threaded?

* Node.js uses a single-threaded model in order to **support async processing**.
* With async processing, an application can perform better and be more scalable under web loads.
* Node.js uses a single-threaded model approach rather than a typical thread-based implementation.

Node.js **supports async processing,** so we can perform multiple operations at the same time.
