# What is NPM

NPM stands for **Node Package Manager,** which is responsible for managing all the packages and modules for Node.js.

Node Package Manager provides two main functionalities:

* Provides online repositories for node.js packages/modules, which are searchable on search.nodejs.org
* Provides **command-line utility** to install Node.js packages and also manages Node.js versions and dependencies.
