# How does Node.js work?

* Node.js is a **virtual machine** that uses JavaScript as its scripting language and runs on a v8 environment.&#x20;
* **It works on a single-threaded event loop** and a **non-blocking 1/0** which provides a high rate as it can handle a higher number of concurrent requests.&#x20;
* By making use of the 'HTTP' module, Node.js can **run on any stand-alone web server**.
