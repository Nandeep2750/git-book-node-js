# Modules in Node.js

Modules are like **JavaScript libraries** that can be used in a Node.js application to **include a set of functions**. To include a module in a Node.js application, use the **require()** function with parentheses containing the module's name.

Node.js has many modules to provide the basic functionality needed for a web application. Some of them include:
